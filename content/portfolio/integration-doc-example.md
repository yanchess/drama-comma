## Overview

As the sole technical writer for the product integration ecosystem, I architected and executed a complete documentation transformation spanning 270+ integration documents. Working independently, I designed documentation standards, information architecture, and operational workflows that became the foundation for how product integrations are documented.

Over multiple release cycles, I balanced two parallel workstreams: creating net-new integration documents from scratch while systematically refactoring a corpus of 220 legacy documents. I prioritized work strategically: new releases took precedence, while legacy refactoring focused on highest-traffic integrations based on user analytics.

My key contributions included:

- Documentation architecture and standards: Designed the structural template for all integration documents, introducing critical sections like **Before you begin** that were previously absent. Also, I standardized parameter documentation formats and streamlined section organization to improve usability.

- Hands-on technical validation: Used test environments and codebases to validate integration procedures, verify parameter requirements, and ensure accuracy without relying solely on SME availability.

- Advanced single-sourcing implementation: Engineered a single-source solution for the integration docs using conditional formatting in Jinja templates and YAML configuration. Eliminated content duplication across related documents while implementing an HTML switcher for seamless user navigation between variants.

- Cross-functional process design: Improved, adapted, and documented a workflow enabling the Support team to systematically surface documentation gaps through structured ticket submission.

- Iterative migration strategy: Executed a phased doc refactoring approach that maintained documentation availability while incrementally modernizing 250 legacy documents, ensuring zero disruption to existing users.

- Autonomous project leadership: Independently defined documentation roadmaps, established quality standards, managed competing priorities across release schedules, and drove continuous improvement without dedicated project management oversight.
