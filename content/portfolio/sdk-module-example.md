## Overview

I transformed auto-generated, messy reference documentation into a polished, consistent developer resource for the core SDK modules.

The auto-generated documentation suffered from multiple critical issues simultaneously: missing parameter descriptions, inconsistent formatting, illogical information structure, and non-native English wording from developer comments. Rather than accept low-quality reference materials, I executed a comprehensive editorial and structural overhaul across all function entries.

My key contributions included:

- Large-scale content remediation: Systematically edited auto-generated documentation to resolve missing descriptions, correct non-idiomatic English, standardize formatting, and restructure information hierarchy across the entire SDK reference doc set.

- Template design and standardization: Adapted patterns from existing API documentation to create a reference documentation template that ensured consistency in parameter descriptions, return value documentation, example formatting, and error handling across all function entries.

- Cross-functional collaboration for accuracy: Partnered directly with engineering teams to identify and document missing parameters, clarify ambiguous method behaviors, and validate technical accuracy while working within their availability constraints to progressively close documentation gaps.

- Iterative quality improvement: Maintained an ongoing backlog of documentation gaps and systematically addressed them as engineering resources became available, ensuring continuous improvement rather than accepting incomplete coverage.
