## Overview

I architected and delivered a subsytem onboarding guide for a large-scaled product tier.

Working without access to a test environment, I partnered directly with the SME to translate complex technical workflows into clear, actionable procedures.

For this document, my key contributions included:

- Cross-functional coordination: Collaborated with parallel documentation teams to ensure seamless integration points in the shared onboarding guide, maintaining procedural continuity across subsystems

- Technical translation: Synthesized screen-share walkthroughs with SMEs and third-party platform documentation into comprehensive configuration guides requiring no prior ticketing system expertise.

- User journey optimization: Mapped documentation placement to match the sequential onboarding workflow, ensuring users could progress through setup and configuration without navigating between disconnected sections or experiencing procedural gaps.

The documentation enabled customers to implement bidirectional synchronization between their product instances and external ticketing systems, enabling organizations to manage security posture at scale.
