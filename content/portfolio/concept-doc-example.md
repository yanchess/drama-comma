## Overview

Under extreme time constraints (2 weeks across a 9-hour time zone difference) I architected and delivered a complete documentation subsystem for a new product tier.

Working without access to a test environment, I partnered directly with the SME to translate complex technical workflows into clear, actionable procedures. I structured and authored 12 technically complex documents from scratch, including hybrid concept-procedure guides that required deep understanding of multiple interconnected systems.

For this project, my key contributions included:

- Information architecture design: Designed and implemented a separate subsection, determining its placement within the broader documentation structure to align with user journey and onboarding flows.

- Strategic documentation planning: Balanced conceptual explanations with procedural precision across all deliverables, ensuring each document served both learning and reference use cases.

- Quality assurance through peer review: Integrated editorial feedback from fellow technical writers, refining documentation for clarity, consistency, and adherence to the Google Cloud style standards across all deliverables.

- Autonomous problem-solving across time zones: Overcame a 9-hour time difference with US-based teams by proactively structuring asynchronous collaboration, making independent architectural decisions when consultation wasn't feasible, and validating approaches through subsequent stakeholder review.
