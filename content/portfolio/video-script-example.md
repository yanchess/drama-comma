## Overview

I scripted and helped to art-direct a complete video learning library of 15 videos ranging from 2-minute concept introductions to 8-minute technical configuration tutorials that bridged marketing vision and technical implementation for both business and developer audiences.

Working with minimal documentation for an unreleased product, I used direct access to test environments to design video flows that accurately represented user workflows. I then translated these experiences into detailed scripts with shot-by-shot storyboards and explicit visual direction, collaborating closely with a video editor to ensure visual elements reinforced the narration.

My key contributions included:

- Dual-audience content strategy: Created a video series that introduced AI capabilities and business value to non-technical stakeholders through concept videos, while providing step-by-step API configuration guidance for technical audience through detailed how-to videos.

- Visual storytelling and art direction: Wrote visual direction notes specifying imagery, iconography, UI simulations, and animation cues for each script segment.

- Shot-by-shot storyboarding: Designed detailed storyboards that synchronized narration timing with visual sequences, ensuring the video editor had complete guidance on pacing, transitions, and on-screen elements for each scene.

- Self-directed technical research: Worked independently with scarce pre-release documentation and hands-on test environment exploration to accurately understand the feature behavior, configuration requirements, and user workflows without extensive SME availability.

- Cross-functional collaboration: Partnered with Product Management and stakeholders through iterative script reviews, incorporating feedback while maintaining technical accuracy and narrative clarity across all videos.

- Workflow-based instructional design: Used test environment access to map authentic user journeys, designing video flows that matched actual configuration sequences rather than theoretical feature descriptions.
