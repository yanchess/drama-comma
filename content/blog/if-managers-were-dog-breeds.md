Do you ever notice how every team or project has managers that feel less like bosses and more like dog breeds?

Years of corporate survival and (theoretically) commendable skills of behavior pattern recognition made me think that while some managers are just genuinely happy to have a sync with you, the others act like they’re protecting their territory from a dangerous trespasser. It’s how I’ve figured out that we’re all living in a giant office dog park---and every company needs its pack, undoubtedly.

Fair warning: These are the my field notes from the IT management safari, not a peer-reviewed taxonomy. If your experience differs, well, woof.

## The Rottweiler Manager

_aka The Intimidating Softie_

The Rottweiler Manager occupies their office like an average nuclear submarine commander and speaks in a voice that could negotiate international treaties, stop rush hour traffic, and make the UN great again (no).

Even though their bark does sound terrifying and their everyday business countenance is all about plotting world domination, they’re actually scanning for threats to their team’s success (leave all the strategic conspiracies to Dobermanns, thank you). They are the ultimate team protectors who’d rather scare away problems (even the potential ones) than let their people fail.

The Rottweiler Manager will growl about missed deadlines with the intensity of a war general, then quietly stay after hours debugging your amateur Excel formulas.

**Friendly mode:** “I’ve got your back. Your front. Your sides. Your lunch and even your decaf coffee, bless its crushed bean heart. See? You’re not going anywhere hungry or unprotected on my watch.”

**Sassy mode:** “I protect this team like Fort Knox, so if you think you can slack off and slip by unnoticed, think again, sunshine.”

The Rottweiler Manager has a security guard energy with a teddy bear soul which makes them formidable corporate bouncers who remember everyone’s coffee orders. And unfinished tasks, but that’s technicality.

## The Golden Retriever Manager

_aka Everyone’s Favorite Human_

The Golden Retriever Manager radiates warmth like a human space heater and maintains an emergency snack drawer that rivals most convenience stores. They’re genuinely invested in everyone’s success and prone to deliver criticism like they’re apologizing for bad weather.

Their default settings let them sandwich constructive feedback between an impressive number of flourishing compliments to leave you thinking that you got promoted when you actually got performance-managed. Their secret weapon is manipulation of angelic cuteness and blanket-like warmth that lets them gently and lovingly coerce you into doing the most mundane tasks with the commendable enthusiasm of a child unwrapping their Christmas gifts.

The Golden Retriever Manager creates environments so positive that people actually want to work harder just to avoid disappointing them.

**Friendly mode:** “You’re doing amazing! I’ve prepared constructive feedback wrapped in so much positivity that it’s practically a cotton candy for your soul!”

**Sassy mode:** “I believe in you so much that I’m genuinely confused why you don’t believe in yourself enough to proofread your emails before sending them.”

The Golden Retriever Managers have unconsciously (and secretly) weaponized niceness, so they can kill you with kindness, only to resurrect you later with encouragement and unshakable wholehearted support.

## The Dobermann Manager

_aka The Sleek Devil of Bureaucracy_

The Dobermann Manager moves through the office with the precision of a Swiss timepiece and the confidence of someone who definitely read all the fine print. They can be intimidatingly competent and vengefully petty, but occasionally the Dobermann Manager gets excited about spreadsheets in a way that’s both impressive and slightly concerning.

Meticulous and unforgiving with their instructions, discussions, and emails, they’re the corporate equivalent of a Formula 1 race car: incredibly precise, surprisingly fast, and occasionally make weird noises that nobody understands.

The Dobermann Manager is that legendary piece of a brilliant executioner who is irreplaceable in the cross-team collaboration: they make their team happy like unicorns by ensuring that the collaborators suffer the 10 Plagues of Bureaucracy. With an unholy glee of someone who eats operation manuals for breakfast, they can juggle multiple overcomplicated projects while being totally oblivious to the fact that not everyone operates at their level of caffeinated efficiency.

**Friendly mode:** “I’ve streamlined our process, optimized our outcomes (x2), and scheduled our success (x3). Oh, and I brought cinnamon rolls because the workflow order should be delicious.”

**Sassy mode:** “I can execute flawless strategies and sniff miniscule inefficiencies from orbit, but somehow I still fail to see why you thought that “winging it” was a viable business plan.”

The Dobermann Manager is sleek, smart, and slightly unhinged about processes. That said, they’re what happens when perfectionism gets an MBA.

## The Corgi Manager

_aka Royalty in Regular Size_

The Corgi Manager commands rooms with the unshakeable confidence of someone who definitely has a crown at home and is all too happy to mention it. They are the only ones who can make arrogance look cute and turn roadmap planning meetings into full-scale therapeutic sessions.

As natural-born leaders who treat every project like a kingdom that they’ve inherited from someone impressively amateur, they expect every team member to behave like a loyal subject who patiently awaits for royal decrees. Just remember that they have an executioner to do the dirty job, too.

The Corgi Manager waddles into boardrooms with the swagger of someone who conquered nations before lunch and still has time for afternoon tea and pancakes. True to their default majestic mode, they somehow make everyone feel both important and slightly inadequate simultaneously.

**Friendly mode:** “I may possess a laidback personality, but it gives me a better perspective on what’s really happening. Now, let’s rule this meeting like the legends we are.”

**Sassy mode:** “I’ve got royal bloodline confidence and zero patience for peasant-level effort, so step up or step aside. Your majesty’s got work to do.”

The Corgi Manager is a pocket-sized monarch with full-sized expectations of a true megalomaniac. They’re essentially Napoleon---if Napoleon was adorable and really good at team building.

## The Chihuahua Manager

_Or, “I’m in charge! Adjust, weaklings.”_

The Chihuahua Manager is all about micro-management and macro-aggression. It’s not about the size. It’s about opinion. A rather exceptionally oppressive and vocal opinion for everything and everyone---even when they’re not a manager, formally.

The Chihuahua Manager possesses enough energy, spite, and combativeness to power entire cities. They ooze judgement left and right just like enriched uranium emits radiation. Essentially, they’re an explosive mix of pure concentrated ambition, entitled indignation, and a deeply ingrained fear to be less than anyone---but stuffed in a relatively humanoid package.

Their vitriol is some kind of chthonic substance that, due to an inexplicable reason, is neither included in the register of substances that repeatedly violate all norms and rules of the Geneva Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, nor listed among reagents that introduced the reasons for putting the Geneva Convention into effect in the first place.

The Chihuahua Manager compensates for their issues with the condensed fury of a thousand suns and the volume control of a fire alarm. They seem convinced that spreadsheets can fix everything---especially, if it’s a spreadsheet to track spreadsheets. The Chihuahua Manager themselves believe that they’re actually just passionate (and, thus, suffering) perfectionists trapped in a world of remarkably uncoordinated and phenomenally incompetent people.

**Friendly mode:** N/A. Scientists still haven’t found any solid proof that the Chihuahua Manager understands the concept of any communication that is not antagonistic or argumentative, let alone a friendly one.

**Sassy mode:** “Cutie, let me tell you, my expectations are gargantuan, and right now you’re failing to meet even the travel-size version. Chop chop.”

The Chihuahua Manager is proof that highly reactive and extremely volatile explosive comes in limited portions, and sometimes that explosive has opinions and instructions about your roadmaps, quarterly reports, the way you like your coffee, and everything else about you. Or anyone else in the proximity of some 8 hundred light years.

Each management style has its pros and cons. Just remember that even though the managers might be different breeds, they all respond to the same thing: results and feedback. And, of course, the occasional treat from the office kitchen :)

P.S. I’d say that developers usually transition into Rottweilers or Golden Retrievers, QAs into Rottweilers, and HRs, probably, into Corgis.

P.P.S. Technical Writers, my precious colleagues, don’t. You. Dare.
